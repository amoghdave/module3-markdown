# Exercise-3

In the space below, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

- A _heading_ with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A _list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly. See `complete` branch for an example.
